# DNA-MOF-storage

This repository hosts ongoing research code and resources for high-density DNA-based data storage using MOFs.

## Current Status
âœ… Sequencing data analysis code has been uploaded.  
ðŸš§ Image encoding/decoding modules are under development.  
ðŸš§ Sequencing datasets are not yet included.

## Project Overview
The project aims to:
- Analyze and process nanopore sequencing data for DNA storage experiments
- Develop DNA-based image encoding/decoding algorithms
- Integrate DNA sequences with MOF structures for high-density storage

## Planned Updates
- Upload image encoding/decoding scripts
- Include experimental sequencing datasets
- Provide example workflows and usage instructions

## Notes
This repository is **under active development**. Code, datasets, and documentation will be updated as the project progresses.
