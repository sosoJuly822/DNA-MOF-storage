# DNA-MOF-storage

This repository hosts ongoing research code and resources for high-density DNA-based data storage using MOFs.

## Project Overview
The project aims to:
- Analyze and process sequencing data for DNA storage experiments
- Develop DNA-based image encoding/decoding algorithms
- Integrate DNA sequences with MOF structures for high-density storage

## Notes
This repository is **under active development**. Code, datasets, and documentation will be updated as the project progresses.
